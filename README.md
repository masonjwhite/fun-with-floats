# Fun With Floats

This repository is a part of my "fun with" series. Each and every day I challenge myself to learn something new. Once I feel like I understand a subject well enough to move onto the next one, I build a small proof of concept or example so that I can reference it in the future. It also has the double benefit of serving as a great learning resource for my Bootcamp students.

My bootcamp students wanted some more examples of the classic tricky CSS float layouts and clearfixes!

## Included Examples
1. Simple Floats
2. Floats with Margins
3. Floats with Inline Element
4. Complex Floats
